    topic: "Fellowship Overview",
    content: "The Headstarter Summer Fellowship is a 7-week intensive software engineering program designed for students ranging from high school freshmen to graduate students. It aims to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world software engineering skills. The fellowship includes building 5 AI projects, participating in 5 weekend hackathons, completing a final project with 1000+ users, interview preparation, resume reviews, and receiving feedback from professional software engineers. The program is structured to boost every area of a participant's resume: experience, skills, projects, and activities."

  {
    topic: "Eligibility and Requirements",
    content: "Applicants must be proficient in at least one programming language and able to commit 20 hours per week to the fellowship. The program is open to students from freshman year of high school to graduate level. While technical skills are important, Headstarter prioritizes passion and interest in software engineering. The fellowship is particularly aimed at those who have been discouraged by the opaque application process for summer internships or feel they lack the experience to be competitive for full-time jobs."

  {
    topic: "Program Structure",
    content: "The fellowship is structured around weekly projects and activities. Each week, new projects are released with coding demos and resources. Participants must complete an AI coaching call at the start of each week to gain access to the projects. Projects are due on Fridays and must be uploaded to Reddit for peer feedback. Every other weekend features a virtual hackathon, with in-person meetups on alternate weekends. From Week 3, participants work in teams and conduct peer evaluations. The last two weeks are dedicated to a final project based on the chosen track, culminating in a demo to software engineers."

  {
    topic: "Tracks and Goals",
    content: "Headstarter offers three tracks for the final project: Track A aims to get 1000 people on a waitlist, create 1000 accounts, or generate $1000 in revenue. Track B focuses on building a startup's current backlog while meeting business requirements. Track C involves getting an accepted PR from an open-source community. Participants choose their track and determine the scope of their final project in the last two weeks of the fellowship."

  {
    topic: "AI Projects and Hackathons",
    content: "The fellowship includes building 5 AI projects throughout the program, providing hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology. Additionally, participants engage in 5 weekend hackathons, offering opportunities to apply skills in intense, collaborative coding sessions. These projects and hackathons are designed to simulate real-world software development scenarios and enhance problem-solving abilities."

    topic: "Career Development",
    content: "Headstarter emphasizes career development through various means. Participants receive interview preparation, helping them navigate technical and behavioral interviews confidently. Regular resume reviews ensure that fellows can effectively showcase their growing skills and experiences. The program also facilitates networking opportunities through meetups and interactions with professional software engineers, helping participants build valuable connections in the industry."
  },
  {
    topic: "Evaluation and Outcomes",
    content: "Throughout the fellowship, participants receive ongoing evaluation and feedback. This includes AI evaluations, team evaluations, and assessments of growth as a Software Engineer. In the final days of the fellowship (September 5th to 9th), participants demo their projects to software engineers. The comprehensive evaluation results are shared with companies, potentially leading to job opportunities for successful fellows."
  },
  {
    topic: "Philosophy and Approach",
    content: "Headstarter's approach is based on several key principles: addressing the increasing demand for senior-level skills in entry-level roles, emphasizing community and real human feedback over commoditized learning, and treating job security like running a business with sales, engineering, and marketing roles. The fellowship aims to level the playing field in tech education and employment, providing practical experience that goes beyond traditional academic learning."
